#Using Rspec for Test-Driven Development

##Getting Started

* Fork and clone this repository
* Run `bundle install` to install dependencies
  * Run `rspec` to run tests
  * Run `rubocop` to lint code

Take a look at the starter code. You'll see blueprints for two different classes within the `src` folder, as well as tests in a `spec` folder for the implementation of these classes.

##Requirements

Implement the classes so that the tests succeed, using TDD principles.

1. Run test (test should fail)
2. Write code to try to make the test pass
3. Run test (if the test fails, return to step 1)
4. Refactor code if needed

Run `rspec` in the starter-code folder to run the tests. Take a look at the specs if you get stuck.
